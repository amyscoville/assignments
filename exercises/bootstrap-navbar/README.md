Instructions:

You are starting a website for a friend. To start, just make a cool Navbar using Bootstrap.

Customize it.

If it's a website for your friends flower shop, you could change the background color and the color of the links.

Don't worry about making the links go anywhere, but they should have appropriate text.

Use Glyphicons for navigations or for the Brand.
