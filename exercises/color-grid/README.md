Without using the bootstrap grid system, create a grid that looks like the below. You don't have to worry about making it responsive at this point.

Here are the colors:

#F5C6D6
#EE2E84
#85CFD8
#8DC63F
#E76E34

Hints:
It's easiest to get the even white "spacing" by actually using a thick, white border around the shapes.
In order to use percentage widths and not have them wrap, you'll need to add the following line to the top of your CSS:
* {
    box-sizing: border-box; 
    font-size: 0px;
}
