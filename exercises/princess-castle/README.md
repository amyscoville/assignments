Requirements:

Create a class for a player that has the following properties:

name of type String
totalCoins of type Number
status of type String (options are Powered Up, Big,Small, and Dead)
star of type Boolean (Is a star active?)
setName of type function - sets name to "Mario" or "Luigi". Has a parameter called namePicked where you pass in "Mario" or "Luigi"
gotHit of type function - this is called whenever the player is hit by an enemy. gotHit() will set the status property accordingly. (Statuses go from "Powered Up" to "Big" to "Small" to "Dead".)
gotPowerup of type function - called when a powerup is received and sets the status accordingly
gameActive of type Boolean, true by default, becomes false when status is Dead

addCoin of function - adds a coin to totalCoins

print of type function - prints to the console the name, totalCoins, status, and star properties. Make sure you make this look nice such as:
Name: Luigi,
Status: Small, etc, etc
Use that class to create the object.

Create a random range function that returns either 0, 1, or 2.

If the value is 0 call the gotHit() function on the object. 
If the value is 1 call the gotPowerup() function on the object 
If the value is 2 call the addCoin() function

Then call the print method on the object.

Perform this random operation 3 different times and call that print function 3 different times.
